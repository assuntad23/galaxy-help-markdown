# [Help] How to use the History Selector

This menu is the **History Selector For Multiview** which allows you to select and **pin** multiple histories to the multiview.

## How to select one or more histories:
1. **Find the histories** you want to select:
   - Scroll this menu to the bottom to load more histories and find the ones you are looking for
   - Find histories using the search field or the filter menu accessible through the toggle button next to the search field
2. **Click anywhere on the History card** to select an individual history (the modal will not be closed)
3. You will see your selected histories highlighted and the <code>n histories selected</code> link at the bottom will indicate your selection size
   - Click that link to reset your selection if needed
4. Once you have a selection (or your existing selection of histories has changed), you can click on the button at the bottom to **Change Selected** histories

:flashlight: Not enough histories? [Create](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/histories_create_new.html) new histories to see them in this menu.

## :question: Help

<details>
<summary><b>What happens if I have <i>no histories selected</i>?</b></summary>
  That is the default behavior and in that case, you are in the <b>Recent Histories Mode</b> where the multiview is "Showing the 4 most recently updated histories. Pin histories to this view by clicking on Select Histories." When in the History Multiview, you can also reset your selection into the <b>Recent Histories Mode</b> by clicking on the button right next to the one that opened this modal titled: <code>fa-clock</code> Recent.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Where do I find an exhaustive list of all of my histories?</b></summary>
  An exhaustive list of all of your histories (and public histories or histories shared with you) can be found in the Histories list accessible by clicking on <b>User > Histories</b> in the masthead on the top, or by clicking on the <b>Histories</b> activity in the activity bar.
</details>

## Other operations in this menu

On the bottom right corner of each history in this menu, you will find a couple buttons:
1. The first `fa-sign-in-alt`, titled _"Set as Current History"_ will set that history as your current/active history in the History Panel on the right.
2. The second `fa-list-alt`, titled _"Open in center panel"_ will open that history in the center, giving you more space to work with the history.

:exclamation: **Neither of these operations will change your Current History**

:flashlight: See a version of this list in your left side panel (if not enabled already) by clicking on the `fa-columns` History Multiview activity in the activity bar.
